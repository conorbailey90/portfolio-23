            ['p',`Web design is a delicate dance between creativity and structure. It's the art of crafting beautiful and functional websites that engage users while conveying information effectively. One fundamental tool that underpins successful web design is the grid system.

            ['p',`Grid systems make it easier to implement responsive design principles like fluid grids and media queries.
